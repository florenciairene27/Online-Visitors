# Predictive Modeling for Online Purchases 

## Overview

This project aims to predict whether an online visitor in an ecommerce website will make a purchase or not using machine learning models. By accurately classifying visitors, businesses can better target potential customers through optimizing marketing strategies, and ultimately increase revenue.

## Project Goals

1. Develop several predictive models to classify whether an online visitor will make a purchase.
2. Handle data imbalance using Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE).
3. Optimize models performance through hyperparameter tuning and threshold adjustments to maximize the F1 score.
4. Compare models performance and choose the final model.
