# Predictive Modeling for Online Purchases 

## Overview

This project aims to predict whether an online visitor in an ecommerce website will make a purchase, leveraging advanced machine learning techniques to improve e-commerce conversion rates. By accurately classifying visitors, businesses can better target potential customers, optimize marketing strategies, and ultimately increase revenue.

## Project Goals

1. Develop a robust predictive model to classify whether an online visitor will make a purchase.
2. Handle data imbalance using Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE).
3. Optimize model performance through hyperparameter tuning and threshold adjustments to maximize the F1 score.
